            <h2>Hi, I'm Matt!</h2>
            <article>
                <p>
                    I am an aspiring software engineer with a background in Public Health and Biostatistics. 
                    I'm set to graduate from Oregon State University's online computer science program in 2025, 
                    and am actively looking for internship opportunities.
                </p>
                <p>Here is the technology stack I utilize in this portfolio:</p>
                
                <h1>Front-end</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>React</li>
                    <li>HTML5</li>
                    <li>CSS3</li>
                    <li>JavaScript</li>
                    <li>Vite</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h1>Back-end</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Express</li>
                    <li>Node.js</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h1>Database</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>MongoDB</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h1>Implementation</h1>
                <p>
                    For this website, I used a mix of web development technologies to build a smooth and responsive 
                    user experience. React helped me create dynamic interfaces with reusable components, while HTML5 
                    and CSS3 gave the site its structure and style. JavaScript added interactivity, and Vite sped up 
                    development with fast build times.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the server side, Node.js ran my JavaScript code, and Express made handling server routes and 
                    requests straightforward. For storing data, MongoDB was used for its flexibility, making it easy 
                    to manage and adapt the data as needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Together, these tools allowed me to build an efficient web application with a focus on performance 
                    and user experience.
